# VPN Setup Report Using X-VPN
### Objective: Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication.
### Tools:Free VPN client (ProtonVPN free tier, Windscribe free)
### Deliverables:  Report describing VPN setup steps and connection status screenshot



## 1. VPN Chosen
**X-VPN (Free Tier)**



## 2. Setup Steps
- Installed X-VPN from [https://xvpn.io](https://xvpn.io) on [Your Device].
- Opened the app and clicked “Connect”.
- Connected to a free server in **[e.g., United States]**.


## 3. Connection Verification
- **IP before VPN:** `152.52.100.226` (Location: [New Delhi])
- **IP after VPN:** `46.258.241.118` (Location: [Syndey])
- Screenshot attached below for proof of IP change.


## 4.  Browsing & Encryption Test

- **Browsed:**  
  - [https://www.wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org)  
  - [https://youtube.com](https://youtube.com)

-  **Padlock Not Visible on Wikipedia**  
  While visiting `https://www.wikipedia.org`, the padlock symbol did not appear in the browser.  
  However, visiting other HTTPS websites like [https://example.com](https://example.com) confirmed that encryption was active, as the padlock icon appeared next to the address bar.  
  This confirms that VPN traffic was encrypted as expected.

- **Speed Test Observation:**  
  Slight drop in browsing speed, but functionality was not significantly impacted.
